# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a study guide for an online bootcamp that would help to organise notes on all the different programming languages. 
I built this project because it helped me to understand the basics of coding and work through building it step by step to help me piece all the information together.
This project helps to organise notes.
I learnt about all the different programming languages and how there are slight variations within each. I learnt that at times I will have to debug code before I can proceed.
